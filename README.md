##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to provide insights into revenue, costs, and order statuses. The goal is to create a dynamic Excel dashboard that automates data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

##  Data Source  
- Sales transaction data  
- Product details  
- Order statuses (Completed, Returned)

##  Tools Used  
- *Microsoft Excel* (Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Dashboard)  
- *Power Query* (Data Processing and Transformation)  
- *Excel Formulas & Functions* (VLOOKUP, Calculated Columns)  
- *Pivot Tables & Charts* (Visualization)  

##  Data Cleaning  
To ensure data consistency and accuracy, the following steps were taken:  

1. *Standardizing Formats:* Unified date, time, and numeric formats.  
2. *Validating Data:* Applied checks for valid emails and correct spelling.  
3. *Removing Duplicates:* Eliminated duplicate entries to maintain integrity.  
4. *Handling Missing Values:* Used imputation or removal where necessary.  
5. *Correcting Inconsistencies:* Fixed variations in spelling and capitalization.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis  
The dataset was analyzed to identify key trends:  

- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit?  
- What are the financial trends over time (Revenue, Cost, Profit)?  
- How do different order statuses evolve over time?

##  Data Analysis  
The following techniques were applied:  

- *Merging Tables:* Combined datasets using unique keys.  
- *Creating Calculated Columns:* Derived new insights from formulas and logical operations.  
- *Applying VLOOKUP:* Linked related data across tables for deeper insights.  
- *Filtering and Sorting:* Focused on relevant subsets of data.  

##  Recommendations  
- Increase *stock* for high-demand products to maximize revenue.  
- Implement strategies to *reduce order returns*.  
- Monitor *sales trends* regularly to adjust pricing and marketing strategies.
